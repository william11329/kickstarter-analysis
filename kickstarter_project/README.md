# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The Purpose of this analysis was to inspect the clients data and provide her 
with specific data sets. Using filtered data can show trends so that she might 
be able to plan accordingly and succeed in launching her kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis displays the kickstarter data proved after it has been filtered to only
show theater related projects. It displays all the projects that were successful, failed
or canceled for each month of the year over the span from 2009-2017. This pivot table
breaks the data down so you can see which moths are popular and which are not.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This data shows the percentage of successful,failed, and canceled play kickstarters
based on the amount they were trying to raise.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the few difficulties with this analysis was properly explaining skewed data.
Because of the specific criteria that was asked for, some of the findings seemed
incorrect and had to be checked over. For instance for the percentages based on 
goals it was asked to display canceled play projects, of which there are none. In
the same table I was asked to display a percentage of successful/failed plays with
a goal of $45000 to $49999, of which there is only one, causing those plots to
display 0% and 100% respectively.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
From the launch dates that we filtered into months, we can see that there was a 
much higher success rate during the month of May. This means based on the analysis
May holds her highest chance of succeeding. We also see there less projects 
launched during the colder months like January, November, and December. So she 
might want to avoid those months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the analysis, the highest percentage of projects succeeding came from the 
kickstarters that asked for less than $1000 in donations. It also shows that only 3 
projects were asking for $45,000 or more, giving the highest failure rates. Although
the succes rates in the $35000-$44999 range were technically high our table shows that 
very few projects asked for that. This leads me to believe the lower your goal is the 
higher your success rate will be.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset is limited to large areas such as entire countries as well as only 
showing a few years worth of Data. It also doesn't show who is hosting these projects
or if they are providing additional advertising.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A table showing how many backers and average donations based on different types of 
theater projects could show specific theater categories that are more popular with 
the backers.
